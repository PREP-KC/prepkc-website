# PREP-KC Website Optimization: Revised Implementation Guide

## üéØ **Strategy: Incremental Migration with Working Build Pipeline**

**IMPORTANT**: You already have build tools and linting configured! Don't rewrite HTML/CSS first. Instead, start with the build pipeline and gradually migrate CSS to SCSS while keeping everything working.

## üí° **Key Success Factors**

1. **Don't rewrite HTML/CSS first** - Start with build pipeline
2. **Keep everything working** - Migrate incrementally
3. **Test frequently** - Small changes are easier to debug
4. **Use existing tools** - You already have everything you need
5. **Document everything** - Future maintenance depends on it
6. **Keep backups** - Always have rollback options
