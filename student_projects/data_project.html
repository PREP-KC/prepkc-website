        </ul>
        <h2>Project Assignment</h2>
        <p>As part of your assessment, you are required to undertake a small data exploration project. Each student will analyze feedback data from recent PREP-KC events, such as Career Jumping and College Visits, collected from participating students.</p>

        <p>The feedback data is stored in a Google Sheet. Access to this sheet is restricted; please use the password provided during class sessions to access the data. It's crucial to complete the final project by the end of the semester. However, to enhance our learning experience and foster collaboration, we will focus on different segments of the project weekly.</p>

        <!-- Centering the Protected Link Section -->
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <button class="btn btn-primary col-2" onclick="accessProtectedLink()">Access Google Sheet</button>
        </div>

        <p>Andrew from Oracle will be contributing his expertise at various stages of our project, offering valuable insights and assistance. This Monday, your task is to dive into the data within the Google Sheet and familiarize yourself with the data profile using the previously mentioned resources. As you navigate through these resources, please ensure to fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDpHuatjLU3OIqARHEotL95vMtiPoWjzMARRo8mWSJfKlTsA/viewform?usp=sf_link">this form</a> to document your exploration process.</p>
        
        <p>Collaboration is encouraged; however, it's important to maintain individuality in your findings and submissions to ensure a diverse range of insights and interpretations.</p>

        <p><strong>Due Date:</strong> Tuesday April 5th 2024</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>

        <strong>Project Objective:</strong>
        <p>Analyze and provide insights on PREP-KC's recent event feedback data to identify key areas of success and opportunities for improvement.</p>
        <p>Pick at least one topic such as participant satisfaction, event impact, or areas needing enhancement.</p>

        <strong>Data Analysis:</strong>
        <p>You should complete a thorough exploration of the dataset provided. Identify patterns, trends, outliers, or correlations in the data.</p>
        <p>Start by forming hypotheses or questions based on initial data exploration and using the data to support or refute these.</p>

        <strong>Visualization and Presentation</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>For projects using Tableau or similar tools, expect clear, informative, and aesthetically pleasing visualizations that effectively communicate the data's story.(At least 2 visuals)</li>
            <li>For PowerPoint/Canva presentations, look for a well-structured narrative that guides the audience through the analysis, supported by data visualizations, statistics, and insights. (At least 5 slides)</li>
            <li>For written analyses, expect clarity, depth, and coherence in the narrative, with appropriate inclusion of charts or tables to illustrate key points. (At least one page)</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Recommendations:</strong>
        <p>Provide insightful observations based on their data analysis. These should go beyond mere descriptions of the data to include interpretations and implications.</p>
        <p>Focus on actionable recommendations or suggestions for PREP-KC based on their findings. These should be practical, data-driven, and clearly linked to the analysis.</p>
