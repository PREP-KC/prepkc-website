        <p>The students of the Pathways to Tech program have embarked on an exciting venture into the world of interactive storytelling. They are diligently crafting design documents, laying the foundation for visual novel projects using Ren'Py, a popular visual novel engine. This hands-on experience allows students to delve into the intricacies of game design, character development, and narrative branching.</p>
    
        <p>For those unfamiliar, a visual novel is a genre of game that blends together elements of literature and interactive media. It presents a story primarily through text, displayed on the screen along with character portraits, backgrounds, and often includes voice acting and sound effects. Player engagement is achieved through decision-making, which can lead to multiple endings and story arcs. It's a digital form of choose-your-own-adventure, where the player's choices shape the direction and outcome of the narrative. Visual novels often focus on storytelling, making them an excellent platform for those who love to weave together compelling narratives and create immersive experiences.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Collaboration with Pathways to Design</strong></p>
        <p>We are collaborating with the Pathways to Design students, who will be creating the assets for our games. Our students are also doing the programming, and we hope to have working demos by the end of the semester.</p>
