# üöÄ PREP-KC Website Optimization: Quick Start Checklist

## ‚úÖ **Immediate Action Items (Start Today!)**

### **Step 1: Verify Your Build Tools (15 minutes)**
- [ ] Open terminal in your project directory
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` - verify development server starts
- [ ] Run `npm run build:css` - verify SCSS compilation works
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` - verify all linting works
- [ ] Run `npm run format` - verify formatting works

**Expected Results:**
- Development server opens at `http://localhost:3000`
- SCSS compiles without errors
- Linting shows current code quality status
- Formatting applies consistent code style

---

### **Step 2: Test Current SCSS Structure (30 minutes)**
- [ ] Check if `css/scss/main.scss` compiles correctly
- [ ] Look for missing SCSS partial files that cause import errors
- [ ] Note which files are missing from the SCSS structure

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ `css/scss/main.scss` exists
- ‚úÖ `css/scss/base/_variables.scss` exists
- ‚ùå Missing: `css/scss/base/_reset.scss`
- ‚ùå Missing: `css/scss/base/_typography.scss`
- ‚ùå Missing: `css/scss/components/_buttons.scss`
- ‚ùå Missing: `css/scss/components/_cards.scss`
- ‚ùå Missing: `css/scss/components/_navigation.scss`
- ‚ùå Missing: `css/scss/layout/_header.scss`
- ‚ùå Missing: `css/scss/layout/_footer.scss`
- ‚ùå Missing: `css/scss/utilities/_helpers.scss`

---

### **Step 3: Create First SCSS Partial (45 minutes)**
- [ ] Create `css/scss/base/_reset.scss`
- [ ] Extract reset styles from `css/style.css` (lines 1-100)
- [ ] Test SCSS compilation: `npm run build:css`
- [ ] Verify no compilation errors

**What to Extract:**
```scss
// css/scss/base/_reset.scss
/* CSS RESET & FONT LOADING STRATEGY */
@font-face {
    font-family: 'DIN1451';
    src: url('../fonts/DINEngschriftStd.woff2') format('woff2'),
         url('../fonts/DINEngschriftStd.otf') format('opentype');
    font-display: swap;
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}

/* Add other reset styles from style.css */
```

---

### **Step 4: Test Build Pipeline (30 minutes)**
- [ ] Run `npm run build` - test complete build process
- [ ] Check if `dist/` folder is created
- [ ] Verify CSS output in `dist/css/style.css`
- [ ] Test built website in browser

**Expected Results:**
- Build completes without errors
- `dist/` folder contains optimized assets
- CSS is minified and optimized
- Website works exactly the same

---

## üîß **If You Encounter Issues**

### **Common Problems & Solutions**

#### **Problem: SCSS compilation fails**
```bash
# Solution: Check for missing partial files
npm run build:css
# Look for "File to import not found" errors
# Create missing partial files one by one
```

#### **Problem: Build process fails**
```bash
# Solution: Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 16+ for esbuild
# Solution: Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

#### **Problem: Development server won't start**
```bash
# Solution: Check if port 3000 is in use
# Solution: Kill existing process or change port
# Edit package.json: "dev": "live-server --port=3001 --open=/"
```

## üìã **Daily Progress Tracking**

### **Day 1 Goals:**
- [ ] Build tools verified and working
- [ ] First SCSS partial created
- [ ] Basic build pipeline tested
- [ ] Development workflow established

### **Day 2 Goals:**
- [ ] Create remaining base SCSS files
- [ ] Test SCSS compilation
- [ ] Begin component migration
- [ ] Document any issues

### **Day 3 Goals:**
- [ ] Complete base SCSS structure
- [ ] Start component migration
- [ ] Test build output
- [ ] Plan next phase

---

## üéØ **Success Criteria for Week 1**

### **By End of Week 1, You Should Have:**
- [ ] Working SCSS compilation pipeline
- [ ] Complete SCSS folder structure
- [ ] First few components migrated to SCSS
- [ ] Development workflow established
- [ ] Build process documented
- [ ] Performance baseline established

### **Key Metrics:**
- SCSS compiles without errors
- Build process creates optimized output
- Website looks and functions exactly the same
- Development server works with hot reload
- All linting and formatting works

---

## üÜò **When to Ask for Help**

### **Ask for Help If:**
- Build tools not working after 2 hours of troubleshooting
- SCSS compilation errors you can't resolve
- Website breaks after SCSS changes
- Performance gets worse instead of better

### **Don't Panic If:**
- First SCSS compilation has errors (expected)
- Some styles look different initially (normal during migration)
- Build process takes longer than expected (first time setup)

---

## üí° **Pro Tips for Success**

1. **Start Small**: Create one SCSS partial at a time
2. **Test Frequently**: Run build after each change
3. **Keep Backups**: Don't delete original CSS until SCSS works
4. **Document Issues**: Note any problems for future reference
5. **Celebrate Progress**: Each working SCSS file is a win!

---

## üìû **Next Steps After Week 1**

Once you have the basic SCSS structure working:

1. **Week 2**: Complete CSS migration to SCSS
2. **Week 3**: Implement performance optimizations
3. **Week 4**: Production deployment and testing

*Remember: You already have all the tools you need. This is about completing what's already started, not starting from scratch!*
