# Website Optimization Overview

## What We're Doing
Transform the PREP-KC website from a collection of HTML/CSS files into a production-optimized, high-performance website.

## Current State
- **Solid Foundation**: Well-structured HTML with good accessibility and SEO
- **Mixed Optimization**: Some performance features implemented, others missing
- **Multiple CSS Files**: 11 separate CSS files that can be consolidated
- **Large Images**: Mixed formats and sizes that need optimization

## Goals
- **50-60% performance improvement**
- **30-40% file size reduction**
- **Modern build pipeline** for easy maintenance
- **Production-ready deployment** with automated optimization

## Key Areas
1. **CSS Architecture**: Consolidate and optimize styles
2. **Image Optimization**: Convert to WebP, implement responsive images
3. **Build Pipeline**: Modern tools for CSS/JS processing
4. **Performance**: Critical CSS, font optimization, lazy loading
5. **Maintainability**: Component-based architecture

## Approach
Use Node.js build tools to automate optimization while keeping the process simple and maintainable.
